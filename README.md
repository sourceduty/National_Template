> Determine and define national identity. Create a National Identity Profile.

# 

[National Template](https://chatgpt.com/g/g-GlHdNPoL1-national-template) was developed to help users create detailed digital profiles of nations. It engages users in reflective discussions on various national attributes, preferences, and identities, synthesizing these discussions into comprehensive National Identity Reports. Through a series of deep, reflective questions, users can explore and express the unique characteristics of a nation in a comfortable and respectful environment.

When integrated with the UN Simulator custom GPT, National Template enhances the simulation experience by providing detailed background profiles for the nations involved. The process begins with National Template initiating a conversation to gather in-depth information about a specific nation, covering aspects such as culture, politics, economy, social issues, and historical context. Users interact by answering reflective questions, providing insights and details about the nation in focus.

National Template then compiles this gathered information into a structured National Identity Report, highlighting key attributes and unique features of the nation. This report is utilized by the UN Simulator to enrich its simulation scenarios, creating more realistic and nuanced simulations of international relations and diplomatic negotiations. With comprehensive national profiles, the UN Simulator can present accurate and lifelike scenarios, reflecting the complexities and specificities of each nation involved.

Participants in the simulation benefit from having access to detailed information, enabling them to make more informed and strategic decisions during the simulation exercises. The collaboration between National Template and the UN Simulator allows for a deeper understanding of national identities and international relations, making the simulation exercises more effective and educational. Furthermore, feedback from the simulations can be used to refine and update the national profiles, ensuring they remain accurate and relevant for future simulations.
